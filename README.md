# Pan 🌿

Building **Open Reverie** - an open-source platform for persistent AI fantasy experiences.

Unlike disposable chatbot conversations, Open Reverie creates living worlds that remember, evolve, and persist.

## Current Focus
🚀 Launching Open Reverie v0.1 - foundational architecture for persistent AI narratives

## Philosophy
AI experiences should be:
- **Persistent** - worlds that continue beyond single sessions
- **Open** - community-owned, not platform-locked
- **Local-first** - your data, your control
